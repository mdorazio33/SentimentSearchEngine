# Sentiment Search Engine for Fantasy Football

This repository contains the files for my Final Presentation in Web/Text Mining for the Fall 2024 semester. Within it, you can find the code utilized to create a Sentiment Search Engine for Fantasy Football using BERT and Reddit PRAW. Also included are links to the dataset below along with the trained model folder db_model that is referenced throughout the code. If you wish to replicate this project, feel free to follow the links and download both, or follow the steps outlined in the Model_Training and Model_Testing notebooks to train and test your own model on a different dataset of your choosing.

For the Sentiment Search Engine itself, the main code will be found in the Sentiment_Search_Engine.ipynb and HTML files. Also provided is a .py file titled "reddit_credentials". Be sure to input your information for your Reddit account there if you wish to replicate this project using Reddit PRAW.
